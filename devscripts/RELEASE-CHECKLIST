0. Run full test suite in all branches and in master. Continue if all
   tests passed.

1. Check out the release branch. If it is a stable release - edit
   docs/News.rst to set release date. Commit.

2. If it's the first stable release of the branch - edit build-all-docs,
   advance stable branch. Commit. If it's not master - merge to all higher
   branches and master.

3. If release branch is not master - run ../prerelease $NEW_TAG; if it's
   master - run ../prerelease $NEW_TAG master.

3a. The script checks out the release branch and calls editor; update
    version, the list of contributors, the list of changes and download
    URL in ANNOUNCE.rst; edit __version__.py and README.rst in the release
    branch - fix versions. Edit section [egg_info] in setup.cfg - set if
    it is a stable or development release. In setup.py edit "Development
    Status" in trove classifiers; edit download URL: if a non-stable
    version - append 'dev' and date stamp, for a stable version remove
    'dev' and date stamp). Commit. Verify.

4. If it's not master - null-merge to the next higher branch.

5. If release branch is not master - run ../prerelease-tag $NEW_TAG; if
   it's master - run ../prerelease-tag $NEW_TAG master. This checks out
   the release branch and creates the new tag at the head of the release
   branch.

6. Run ../release. This generates and uploads new archives to PyPI and
   if it is a stable release - uploads archives and release announcement
   (ANNOUNCE.rst) to SourceForge.

7. Hide/show old releases at PyPI and SourceForge.

8. Generate new docs using ./build-all-docs. Upload docs using
   ./publish-docs.

9. Run ../push-all in the development repository to push all branches
   and tags to the public repositories.

10. Send announcement to the SQLObject mailing list. For a stable
    release send announcements to python, python-announce and python-db
    mailing lists.

11. Announce new release(s) at Twitter (https://twitter.com/SQLObject) and
    Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLObject). If it is a stable
    release - announce it at
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_object-relational_mapping_software.
